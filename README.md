# Rain Logs

This was a project that I made to show some API work. This app keeps track of the rainfall at your construction sites. It uses the Google Maps API to find the longitude and latitude of your address, then sends those coordinates to the National Weather Service API to get the rainfall from the last 24 hours and from the last week.

## Walkthrough

Once you've signed up you can create project sites to track by entering a name for the project and an address.
